Homework 3 Readme

Included in this directory is a makefile that will generate each of the files.
hw-orig: the original, unedited file (save for proper spacing)
hw-opt: the optimized version of the program, this may be run using any number
of threads and will utilize the OpenMP libraries.
hw-opt-3: the optimized version of the program compiled with the -O3 flag. This
will run the most optimized version of the program because it utilizes compiler
optimizations.

To run the configurations used in the report, use the supplied hw03.sh script.
